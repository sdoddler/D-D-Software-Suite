Description = On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all  of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it w ill move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
Description = Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
Description = The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command youve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.
Description = At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

Description = Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance.

Description = If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.   
[Antimagic Field]
Description = A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells cant be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even m agic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.
Description = Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and cant protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesnt function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.
Description = Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.
Description = Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, cant extend into the sphere.

If a magic w eapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
Description = Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as w ell as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.
Description = Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by m agic temporarily winks out  of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

[Antipathy/Sympathy]
Description = This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice.
Description = You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
Description = You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the auras effect.
Description = Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target.

The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it cant see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and cant see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.
Description = Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it cant w illingly m ove away from the target.
Description = If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a W isdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
Description = Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.

You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item. 
Description = Mask. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin's Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.
[Astral Projection]
Description = You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesnt need food or air and doesnt age.
Description = Your astral body resembles your m ortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of  a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
Description = Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.
Description = Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
Description = The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.
Description = The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creatures original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creatures astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.
Description = If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.   
[Augury]
Description = By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a humans. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.

Description = If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isnt being w orn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.
Description = If any of this spells area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.   
[Darkvision]
Description = You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.   
[Daylight]

[Delayed Blast Fireball]
Description = A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Description = The spells base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.
Description = If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.
Description = The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that arent being w orn or carried.
Description = At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.   
[Demiplane]
Description = You create a shadowy d oor on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered.
Description = When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.
Description = Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents  of a demiplane created by a casting  of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.   
[Detect Evil and Good]
Description = For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located.

[Detect Magic]
Description = For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

[Detect Thoughts]
Description = For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesnt speak any language, the creature is unaffected.
Description = You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creatures thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creatures mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it w orries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creatures thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.
Description = Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.
Description = You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you cant see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.
Description = You cant detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesnt speak any language.
Description = Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you cant see it, but it must still be within range.   
[Dimension Door]
Description = You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as “ 200 feet straight downward” or “upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.” You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesnt exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller w ho is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.
Description = If you w ould arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.   
[Disguise Self]
Description = You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you u se your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You cant change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent  of the illusion is up to you.
Description = The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone w ho touches it w ould feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
Description = To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.   
[Disintegrate]
Description = A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.
Description = A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.
Description = A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile  of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.
Description = This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation  of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A m agic item is unaffected by this spell.
Description = At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.   
[Dispel Evil and Good]
Description = Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
Description = You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.
Description = Break Enchantment. As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.
Description = Dismissal. As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isnt there already). If they arent on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.   
[Dispel Magic]
Description = Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends.

[Divination]
Description = Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a gods servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.
Description = The spell doesnt take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain  of a companion.
Description = If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.   
[Divine Favor]
Description = Your prayer empowers you with divine radiance. Until the spell ends, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage on a hit.   
[Divine Word]
Description = You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range.

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesnt receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
Description = You can u se your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesnt do anything that you dont allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
Description = Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.
Description = At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a Level = 5th spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.

Description = While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane  of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey.

[Dream]
Description = This spell shapes a creatures dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you.

Description = If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the targets dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment  of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early.

If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a W isdom saving throw.

You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise cant move.
Description = Minor physical damage to the stone doesnt harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit w ithin it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you.

Description = Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesnt disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
Description = The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any p iece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spells area disappears immediately.

Description = You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creatures memory isnt altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.
Description = A modified memory doesnt necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creatures natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs.
Description = An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.
Description = A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creatures true memory.
Description = At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the targets memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creatures past (9th level).

You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isnt obliged to do so.

Description = The target assumes the hit points of its new form.
Description = When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed.

You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.
Description = The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the walls layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layers properties as described below.
Description = The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer.
Description = Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration  of the spell. A rod  of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.
Description = 1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Description = While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks cant pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
Description = 2. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks cant pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.
Description = 3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.
Description = 4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.
Description = 5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Description = This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.
Description = 6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained.
Description = It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures dont need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.
Description = While this layer is in place, spells cant be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.
Description = 7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a W isdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DMs choosing and is no longer blinded.
Description = (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isnt its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.   
[Produce Flame]
Description = A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
Description = The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.
Description = You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.
Description = This spells damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).   
[Programmed Illusion]
Description = You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.
Description = When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.
Description = The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area.
Description = For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct w ord or phrase.
Description = Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.   
[Project Image]
Description = You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of  intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
Description = You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.
Description = You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.
Description = Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.   
[Protection from Energy]
Description = For the duration, the w illing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.
[Protection from Evil and Good]
Description = Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
Description = The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also cant be charmed, frightened, or p os sessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or p ossessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.   
[Protection from Poison]
Description = You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.
Description = For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.   
[Purify Food and Drink]
Description = All nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.   
[Raise Dead]
Description = You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creatures soul is both w illing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
Description = This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesnt, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these arent first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell cant return an undead creature to life.
Description = This spell closes all mortal w ounds, but it doesnt restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
Description = Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a - 4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.   
[Telepathic Bond]
Description = You forge a telepathic link among up to eight w illing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration.
Description = Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less arent affected by this spell.
Description = Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it cant extend to other planes  of existence.   
[Ray of Enfeeblement]
Description = A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell ends.
Description = At the end of each of the targets turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.   
[Ray of Frost]
Description = A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
Description = The spells damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).   
[Regenerate]
Description = You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).
Description = The targets severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes.
Description = If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.   
[Reincarnate]
Description = You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the targets soul isnt free or w illing to do so, the spell fails.
Description = The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creatures race to change. The DM rolls a d 100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the DM chooses a form.
Description = d100 Race 01-04 Dragonborn 05-13 Dwarf, hill 14-21 Dwarf, mountain 22-25 Elf, dark 26-34 Elf, high 35-42 Elf, wood 43-46 Gnome, forest 47-52 Gnome, rock 53-56 Half-elf 57-60 Half-orc 61-68 Halfling, lightfoot 69-76 Halfling, stout 77-96 Human 97-00 Tiefling The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.   
[Remove Curse]
Description = At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owners attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.   
[Resistance]
Description = You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after m aking the saving throw. The spell then ends.   
[Resurrection]
Description = You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didnt die of old age, and that isnt undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.
Description = This spell neutralizes any p oisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesnt, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects arent removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.
Description = This spell closes all mortal w ounds and restores any missing body parts.
Description = Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a - 4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
Description = Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you cant cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.   
[Reverse Gravity]
Description = This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100- foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that arent somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.
Description = If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.
Description = At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.   
[Revivify]
Description = You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
Description = This spell cant return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.   
[Rope Trick]
Description = You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long.
Description = One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.
Description = The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.
Description = Attacks and spells cant cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.
Description = Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.   
[Sacred Flame]
Description = Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.
Description = The spells damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).   
[Sanctuary]
Description = You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a W isdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesnt protect the w arded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.
Description = If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.   
[Scorching Ray]
Description = You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.
Description = Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.
Description = At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.   
[Scrying]
Description = You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a W isdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows youre casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.
Description = Knowledge Save Modifier Secondhand (you have heard of the target) +5 Firsthand (you have met the target) +0 Familiar (you know the target well) -5 Connection Save Modifier Likeness or picture -2 Possession or garment -4 Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like -10 On a successful save, the target isnt affected, and you cant use this spell against it again for 24 hours.
Description = On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you w ere there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration.
Description = A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.
Description = Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell.
Description = When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesnt move.   
[See Invisibility]
Description = For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.   
[Seeming]
Description = This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance.
Description = An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
Description = The spell disguises physical appearance as w ell as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You cant change a targets body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
Description = The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creatures outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or w ould feel the creatures head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone w ho reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
Description = A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.   
[Sending]
Description = You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.
Description = You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesnt arrive.   
[Sequester]
Description = By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and cant be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.
Description = If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesnt grow older.
Description = You can set a condition for the spell to end early.
Description = The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target.
Description = Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.   
[Shapechange]
Description = You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature cant be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any c lass levels or the Spellcasting trait.
Description = Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creatures bonus in place of yours. You cant use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.
Description = You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesnt reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you arent knocked unconscious.
Description = You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You cant use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense.
Description = You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.
Description = When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to w ear a piece of equipment, based on the creatures shape and size. Your equipment doesnt change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form cant wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.
Description = During this spells duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.   
[Shatter]
Description = A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.
Description = A nonmagical object that isnt being worn or carried also takes the damage if its in the spells area.
Description = At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.   
[Shield]
Description = An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.   
[Shield of Faith]
Description = A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature  of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.   
[Shillelagh]
Description = The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with natures power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that w eapon, and the weapons damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isnt already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go  of the weapon.   
[Shocking Grasp]
Description = Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it cant take reactions until the start of its next turn.
Description = The spells damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).   
[Silence]
Description = For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it.
Description = Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.   
[Silent Image]
Description = You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isnt accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.
Description = You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
Description = Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.   
[Simulacrum]
Description = You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature.
Description = It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creatures hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.
Description = The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.
Description = If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.
Description = If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.   
[Sleep]
Description = This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber.
Description = Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).
Description = Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creatures hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creatures hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.
Description = Undead and creatures immune to being charmed arent affected by this spell.
Description = At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.   
[Sleet Storm]
Description = Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.
Description = The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spells area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.
Description = If a creature is concentrating in the spells area, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.   
[Slow]
Description = You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.
Description = An affected targets speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it cant use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creatures abilities or magic items, it cant make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.
Description = If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesnt take effect until the creatures next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it cant, the spell is wasted.
Description = A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.   
[Spare the Dying]
Description = You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.   
[Speak with Animals]
Description = You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DMs discretion.   
[Speak with Dead]
Description = You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and cant be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
Description = Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesnt return the creatures soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse cant learn new information, doesnt comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and cant speculate about future events.   
[Speak with Plants]
Description = You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spells area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.
Description = You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing v ines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.
Description = Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DMs discretion. The spell doesnt enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.
Description = If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.
Description = This spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.   
[Spider Climb]
Description = Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.

Description = The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns.
Description = The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration.
Description = When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
Description = The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that cant see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.   
[Spirit Guardians]

[Suggestion]
Description = You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you.

Description = If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
Description = The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.
Description = You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.
Description = You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creatures physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers).

If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it cant be held or carried by an unwilling creature.
Description = The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d 100 and consults the table.
Description = Familiarity Mishap Similar Area Off Target On Target Permanent circle — — — 01-100 Associated object — — — 01-100 Very familiar 01-05 06-13 14-24 25-100 Seen casually 01-33 34-43 44-53 54-100 Viewed once 01-43 44-53 54-73 74-100 Description 01-43 44-53 54-73 74-100 False destination 01-50 51-100 — — Familiarity. “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.
Description = “Associated object” means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizards library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lichs secret tomb.
Description = “Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you arent very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone elses description, perhaps from a map.
Description = “False destination” is a place that doesnt exist.
Description = Perhaps you tried to scry an enemys sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.

Description = Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled.
Description = For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d 10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you w ere teleporting to a coastal city and w ound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
Description = Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area thats visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizards laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
Description = Mishap. The spells unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).   
[Teleportation Circle]
Description = As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice w hose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
Description = Many m ajor temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.
Description = You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
Description = The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it cant cross an elevation change  of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk cant move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.
Description = If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it cant move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

Description = A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isnt pushed.
Description = In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spells effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
Description = At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.   
[Time Stop]
Description = You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.
Description = This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you.

You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation becomes permanent.
Description = Shapechangers arent affected by this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isnt affected by this spell.
Description = Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the targets (or its level, if the target doesnt have a challenge rating). The targets game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.
Description = The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesnt reduce the creatures normal form to 0 hit points, it isnt knocked unconscious.
Description = The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it cant speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions.
Description = The targets gear melds into the new form. The creature cant activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
Description = Object into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creatures size is no larger than the objects size and the creatures challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns.
Description = You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creatures statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.
Description = If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.
Description = Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form.

Description = The wall can have any shape you desire, though it cant occupy the same space as a creature or object.

[Wall of Thorns]
Description = You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.
Description = When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
Description = A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement.
Description = Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Description = At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.   
[Warding Bond]
Description = This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.
Description = The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet.
Description = It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.   
[Water Breathing]
Description = This spell grants up to ten w illing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.   
[Water Walk]
Description = This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.
Description = If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.   
[Web]
Description = You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The w ebs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.
Description = If the w ebs arent anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. W ebs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
Description = Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
Description = A creature restrained by the w ebs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
Description = The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.   
[Weird]
Description = Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration.
Description = The illusion calls on the creatures deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the start of each of the frightened creatures turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4 d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.   
[Wind Walk]
Description = You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as w isps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and cant move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.
Description = If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it cant land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.   
[Wind Wall]
Description = A wall of strong w ind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.
Description = When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Description = The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects cant pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss.
Description = (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form cant pass through it.   
[Wish]
Description = Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.
Description = The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You dont need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components.
Description = The spell simply takes effect.
Description = Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice: • You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isnt a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
Description = • You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.
Description = • You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
Description = • You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lichs life drain attack.
Description = • You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponents successful save, a foes critical hit, or a friends failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
Description = You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain w ere dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence  of the items current owner.
Description = The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell w eakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage cant be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isnt 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each  of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.   
[Word of Recall]
Description = You and up to five w illing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary.
Description = You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.
Description = You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isnt dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.   
[Zone of Truth]
Description = You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spells area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature cant speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
Description = An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
